# Netflix-Clone
“This is a Netflix website clone, built using HTML5 and CSS3. It replicates Netflix’s design, featuring a navigation bar, hero section, various Netflix feature sections, a FAQ section, and a footer. This project was created for educational purposes, following a tutorial from ‘Code with Harry’ on YouTube.”
